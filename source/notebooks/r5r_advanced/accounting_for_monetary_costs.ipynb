    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the monetary costs of public transport trips in the calculation of \n",
    "travel time matrices and accessibility estimates is a major challenge faced by \n",
    "researchers and planning practitioners. Each public transport system can have \n",
    "its own set of rules for calculating fares, with varying levels of complexity. \n",
    "Moreover, there are important trade offs between travel time and monetary costs \n",
    "across multiple trip alternatives and are currently not captured by any \n",
    "multimodal routing engine, except for R5.\n",
    "\n",
    "R5 has native capabilities and an open architecture for creating and including \n",
    "fare structures in routing models, making it possible to estimate travel time \n",
    "matrices and accessibility estimates simultaneously considering different \n",
    "combinations of time and monetary cost cutoffs. The main challenge, however, is \n",
    "that a specific fare structure for each city needs to be programmed in Java and \n",
    "tightly integrated into R5, making this functionality out of reach for those who \n",
    "do not know how to code in Java (i.e. most of us!).\n",
    "\n",
    "To help tackle this challenge, `r5r` has a simple generic rule-based fare \n",
    "structure that can be configured via a predefined set of properties and rules \n",
    "that can be set directly from R or using external tools such as text editors and\n",
    "spreadsheets. This approach currently available in `r5r` is able to account for \n",
    "the monetary costs of public transport systems that follow a simple set of fare \n",
    "rules according to which the cost of a journey depends on combinations of modes \n",
    "(see details below).\n",
    "\n",
    "**This tutorial shows the features of `r5r`s fare structure. It also uses a \n",
    "reproducible example to demonstrate how to configure the fare structure to \n",
    "account for monetary costs when generating travel time matrices and accessibility \n",
    "estimates with `r5r`**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Details\n",
    "\n",
    "A common feature among many public transport services is the possibility of \n",
    "discounted transfers, when passengers can use a single ticket for a trip composed \n",
    "of multiple rides sometimes combining different transport modes. Such trips usually \n",
    "come with a discount in the second or subsequent fares, as well as a limit on the \n",
    "number of discounted transfers the user can make and/or a time limit for using that \n",
    "discount. This is the type of fare structure currently covered by `r5r`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We acknowledge that there are several types fare rules that vary from one public \n",
    "transport system to another. According to these rules, the cost of a journey can \n",
    "differ, for example, depending on: different costs for each trip leg, transport \n",
    "mode or route; distance- or zone-based fares; different fares for types of riders \n",
    "(e.g elderly people or students) or time of the day (e.g. peak and off-peak hours); \n",
    "among many others rules. As such, taking all of these possible rules into \n",
    "consideration when calculating the monetary cost of multimodal can be quite \n",
    "difficult. `r5r` currently does not cover these more complex fare rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fare calculator currently available in `r5r` is not intended to be a robust \n",
    "solution that can take into consideration all public transport systems and their \n",
    "specific fare rules. That would be a Herculean task. The features included in \n",
    "`r5r`'s fare calculator are inspired by our empirical observations of Brazilian \n",
    "public transport systems, and is meant to be used mainly in the [Access to Opportunities project](https://www.ipea.gov.br/acessooportunidades/en/). Everyone else is welcome to use it, if the current features suit their needs.\n",
    "obs. The GTFS format has some features for specifying public transport fares, but\n",
    "those features are quite limited and are not enough for adequately representing \n",
    "many use cases. A new version of that specification is currently being developed \n",
    "[Fares V2](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/252), but it may take some \n",
    "time for it to be approved and for transport agencies actually start providing \n",
    "GTFS feeds with full fare information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "In this tutorial, we will be using the sample data set for the city of Porto \n",
